Dear Evaluator,

Greetings.

Kindly note
1. Scrips needs to be placed in the same folder as the data (household_power_consumption.txt) file is located. Preferably, Kindly put all the R files and the data file in the Current Working directory

2. Kindly install sqldf package with all its dependant packages. Have used this to select data from the 2 days in question.

3. You will find the graphs created with the same names as instructed, in the Current Working Directory

With Regards
